# 📄 Docs

Read the [documentation](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/resources/godot-2d-topdown-template).

To explore a specific topic in more detail, you can refer directly to the code—**all key properties and functions are fully documented**.  

When starting your own project, you can safely remove all scenes that begin with **"playground_"**, as they are only meant for demonstration purposes. Then, set your desired starting level by configuring the **`start_level`** property in the `start_screen.tscn` scene.

## [Character Controller](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/character-controller)

Take full control of your characters: make them move, run, attack, jump, and flash while managing their states seamlessly.

## [Interaction System](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/interaction-system)

Enable your characters to interact with the game world. Trigger actions such as opening a chest, activating switches, or unlocking doors using the flexible interaction system.

## [Inventory System](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/inventory-system)

The inventory manages all the items owned by a player. The project provides a simple node (`Inventory.tscn`) assigned as a child of the player, which shows all the items owned by him. You can delete this inventory and create your own according to your preferences. Press _ESC_ on your keyboard to open/close the inventory.

## [Save/Load System](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/save-load-system)

Easily save and load game progress, including player data, entity positions, and the current state of state machines. Saved data persists across levels and can be stored in a file for later retrieval, allowing players to continue from where they left off.

## [State Management](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines)

State machines form the backbone of this template, controlling characters, NPCs, enemies, objects, and more. Each state focuses on a single behavior, allowing you to decide when and how states are activated.

## [Scenes Transition](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/scenes-transition)

Seamlessly move between scenes, whether transitioning from a title screen to a level or from one level to another, and customize the transition effects to match your game's aesthetic.

## [User Prefs and Localization](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/user-prefs-and-localization)

Save and load user preferences, such as music and sound effect volumes or selected language. Effortlessly implement multi-language support and game localization.

## [Dialogue System](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/dialogue-system)

Integrate a robust dialogue system to display message boxes and manage dialogues between game characters, enhancing narrative depth and player engagement.

## [Tilemaps and Levels](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/tilemaps-and-levels)

If you plan to use Tilemaps and the pre-built Level scene to build your levels, here you can discover some useful tips to create new levels and setting up autotiles in no time.

## [Debugger](https://alchemy-pot.web.app/godot-2d-topdown-template/debugger)

Simplify testing with a configurable debugger. Test features like saving sessions, toggling player collisions, restoring health, or blocking enemies. The debugger is extendable, so you can add custom functionalities as needed.

## In Conclusion...

The Godot 2D Top-Down Template is one of the most comprehensive systems I have designed and developed. It is the result of my experience creating and playing various top-down action-adventure and RPG-style games. My hope is that this template helps you build something amazing and that one day, I’ll get to play your game!

The template is fully open-source, so feel free to explore the code and customize it to fit your needs.
